# Guitar-Chords-and-Scales
Code Louisville C# Class Project

## Description

This program will take musical notes from the user and give them what possible chords those notes could be in.

## Instructions

1. Enter one note at a time and press enter after each note you enter. 
2. Format the notes like "A" or "C#" or "Bb".
3. Be careful not to enter too much, as this will not yeild a possible chord. Musically, too many notes results more in a chord cluster or a combination of chords that are too complex for this program to show.
